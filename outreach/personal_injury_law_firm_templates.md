We automated Phoenix PD's portal. Reports in 48 hours for $69.

## Objection Handlers

**"We have paralegals for this"**
"Your paralegals should be working on case strategy, not waiting on hold. We free them for higher-value work."

**"How do we know it's legitimate?"**
"Full audit trail, screenshots of every submission, Phoenix PD confirmation numbers. More documentation than manual requests."

**"We don't handle many Phoenix cases"**
"Even 2-3 cases per month justify the cost. One delayed settlement pays for years of service."

**"Our clients can wait"**
"Can they? 73% of PI clients switch firms if their case stalls. Fast service wins referrals."
