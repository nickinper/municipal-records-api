## Template 2: Initial Cold Outreach (Alternative)

**Subject:** Phoenix PD admits they have a backlog - we solved it

Hi [Name],

Phoenix PD's own website now says:
"Due to high volume...experiencing a backlog...extended wait time"

Your adjusters know this means 18+ months for written requests.

We automated their portal. Your traffic crash and incident reports ($5 each) submitted instantly, tracked automatically.

Current process: Wait 18 months + $5 fee + staff time
Our process: 48 hours + $5 fee + $49 automation = Done

Volume pricing: Order 11+ reports, save 20% automatically.

Test with one claim: [payment link]

P.S. Their system crashes with special characters. Ours doesn't.
