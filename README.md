## ⚖️ Legal

This service automates publicly available government processes. We do not access restricted data or store police records. All activities comply with public records laws.

## 🏆 The Mission

Every day, justice is delayed by bureaucracy. Insurance claims sit. Legal cases stall. We're building the infrastructure to make government data move at the speed of business.

**Current Status**: System operational. Payments live. First customer imminent.
