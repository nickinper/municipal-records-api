## ⚖️ Legal

This service automates publicly available government processes. All activities comply with relevant laws and regulations. We do not access or store sensitive personal information.

## 🏆 Why This Matters

Every day, insurance claims are delayed, legal cases stall, and advocacy work is hindered by bureaucratic inefficiency. We're building the infrastructure to make government data accessible at the speed of business.
