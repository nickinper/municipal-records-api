Subject: Reduce Phoenix Police Report Wait from 18 Months to 48 Hours

Hi [First Name],

Quick question - how much is the 18-month Phoenix PD records backlog costing [Company Name] per claim?

If you're like most insurers we've spoken with, each delayed police report costs roughly:
- $2,400 in additional interest payments (on a $50K claim)
- $500 in extended adjuster time
- 15% higher chance of litigation due to delays

**We've automated the entire Phoenix PD records request process.**

Instead of:
❌ Paying staff $85-140 per request to wait in line
❌ Waiting 18 months for written requests
❌ Managing paper confirmations and follow-ups

Your team gets:
✓ Automated submission in under 60 seconds
✓ Real-time tracking with Phoenix PD confirmation numbers
✓ API integration with your claims system
✓ 48-72 hour turnaround (vs 18 months)

**The Math for [Company Name]:**
- Current cost: $120/request + $2,400 in claim delays
- Our cost: $79/request with instant submission
- Net savings: $2,441 per claim

For your estimated 200 monthly Phoenix-area claims, that's $488,200 in annual savings.

**Client Results:**
"Municipal Records API reduced our Phoenix claim resolution time by 94%. What took 18 months now takes days." - Regional Insurance Director

Subject: [Company Name] - Quick Question

Hi [First Name],

Last email, promise.

I'm curious - if you could eliminate the 18-month wait for Phoenix police reports tomorrow, what would that mean for your Q1 claim resolution metrics?

If it's not a priority right now, I'll check back in Q2. But if those delays are costing you what they're costing our other insurance clients (~$2,400 per claim), let's talk.
